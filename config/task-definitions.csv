A small group including expertise in the collection, use and technical aspects of the data can be worth much more than the sum of its parts in all phases: planning, execution and documentation. Members of any data coordinating group, data governance group or other mechanism to address data issues across departments will be valuable members of the Working Group. Difficulty assembling a working group (including getting commitments to meet on a regular basis) can be a sign that there is not yet enough support to make the project viable. Consider this task complete after the first meeting of the Working Group."
Decision-Makers,Yes,4,moderator female,supervisor account,Essential: Planning and Buy-In,Decision_Makers,http://drive.google.com/open?id=1JCvf44_sww4qs230fEsnbMtbaF7vuIqPigki4t8P3Zo,Working Group,Who are the movers and shakers whose support might help the project succeed? Who could hinder the project? Think as broadly as possible. It is particularly helpful to find an executive champion for the project -- someone influential in upper management who can and will promote or defend the project.
Resource Assessment,Yes,5,money bag,local gas station,Essential: Planning and Buy-In,Resource_Assessment,http://drive.google.com/open?id=159amGMdUwiQEHYZFDPzOL5hhoelGhnpTUw_FoRkQivQ,Working Group,"A realistic assessment of your resources (with the help of the Working Group) will help you plan projects than can be completed, documented and touted by your department, your agency or the officials who hold the purse strings."

These are available in various forms, including desktop packages that you can run in-house and cloud-based packages. In-house analysts may be able to build reasonable ad-hoc tools. Choosing a tool early will allow time for any necessary procurement and staff training. Find candidate tools by web searches, by asking colleagues for recommendations. “Data Profiling,” “Data Cleansing” and “Data Quality” are common keywords used to describe the tools you are looking for."
Communication Plan,Yes,10,cornet,textsms,Essential: Planning and Buy-In,Decision_Makers,http://drive.google.com/open?id=1JCvf44_sww4qs230fEsnbMtbaF7vuIqPigki4t8P3Zo,Decision Makers,"How will you make sure that key decision-makers understand (at whatever level is appropriate) the goals and needs of your project? Create schedules for keeping each decision-maker up-to-date, and set reminders in your calendar (or whatever system you use to make sure things get done)."
Data Inventory,Yes,11,barcode,business,Essential: Planning and Buy-In,Inventory,http://drive.google.com/open?id=1IfaUnSA_orrXLhDX1Si5GVTO3K1ZIgi-O_jSUYiioW8,"Final Goal Statement, Working Group","The scope of your data inventory -- e.g., within one department, or government-wide on a particular topic -- will depend on the goal of your project. Valuable datasets may be hiding in unexpected places, so the members of the Working Group, or even more widespread brainstorming or surveys may be helpful."

If you’ve entered an address into an online form, you’ve probably seen a drop-down menu of states. The form feeds information into a dataset, and the drop-down menu helps to keep the dataset clean. Every entry in the “state” field will be a real state, and each state will have just one spelling. US territories (such as Guam) are sometimes included and sometimes omitted. Consistency of reference data within and between datasets makes merging, duplicating and joining data more effective."

For example, house numbers on a certain street must be within a certain range; real estate sale prices shouldn’t be negative, and no one alive today was born before 1900. Restate business rules in the language of your database (e.g., DOB >= 01/01/1900). Enforcing business rules, usually at the data collection point or during maintenance, will give early warning of both mistakes (such as incorrect data input) or systemic issues (such as the need for a mechanism for government-wide updating of street information when a new block is developed)."

What events beyond your control compromise your data? How often do they occur? How often is data planned to be collected or revised? What internal agency issues might interfere with execution of the plan? Are the data current and available for use in the timeframe needed by users? In looking for causes of data decay it’s useful to consider each stage of the Life Cycle, looking for loss of expertise, process automation, new data uses and changes in the real world that are not captured in the data. Document Root Causes."

Sometimes two rows in a table are strictly identical, or differ only in their primary key. Sometimes a single item in the real world can be described twice in a database with a variety of spellings, or with differences in some fields but not others…. Deduplication of one data table will affect all related tables. Consult your data model. Deleting or merging records (e.g., constituent records) will delete an identifier, which may orphan records in other tables (e.g., contact event records).... Deduplication can be labor-intensive. Deduplication, if done too quickly or carelessly, can result in major damage. Plan, prepare and test methodology before making any irreversible changes to the data. Don’t swim alone -- have at least one other knowledgeable person review the methodology and the results of testing the methodology before applying the methodology to the master data. Document any Root Causes found."

Whether duplicates were created by people entering single records, or by larger scale data manipulations, it is usually more efficient in the long run to prevent duplications than to fix them. If the duplicate-creating processes are not under your control, the Working Group may be able to help secure the cooperation of the relevant people or departments."

The ideal comparison of the data to the real world entities tends to be expensive, while the least expensive options (comparison to proxy sources of data, sampling) may yield misleading results. To picking the right assessment method(s), it helps to know how the results of the assessment will be used. Creating a template for the final accuracy assessment report may help guide the many choices and keep procedures focused on the final, useful result. Document any Root Causes found.
